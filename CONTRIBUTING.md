# Project ChallengeClient Coding Standards

## General
This section lists the official conventions of the languages Kotlin and Java. This project tries to follow them as closely as possible and we expect outside developers to do the same when working on the client.

**Additional, non-standard conventions are listed below. These must also be followed.**

### Kotlin
* Follow Kotlin's official [code conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html#coding-conventions).
* Have a look at Kotlin's official [documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/).

### Java
* Have a look at Oracle's [Java Code PDF document](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf).
* Read the Wikipedia article on [Java's Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_syntax).
* Look at Oracle's [Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/).

# Files
### Generation

To document the ownership of a file, we include the following text in all code files *(.kt and .java)* at the beginning of the file:
```kotlin

```
